# JAVA-ATM-Program
Language :- Java Programming. This ATM Program will work same as an ATM but with fixed balance amount i.e. 100000 amount. At very first you will asked either you want to withdraw or deposit or check balance or exit. After choosing Withdraw option, you have to enter an amount to withdraw. Later a message will displayed to collect your money. With Balance option you can check the balance amount in your account. While depositing money, you have to enter amount you want to deposit and later on a message will display that your money is deposited. Choosing Exit will stop the execution of the program. I have used NetBeans IDE here.
